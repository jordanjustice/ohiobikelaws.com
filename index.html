<h3>&sect; 4501.01. Definitions.</h3>
<div class="law"><p>As used in this chapter and Chapters 4503., 4505., 4507., 4509., 4511.,4513., 4515., and 4517.
of the Revised Code, and in the penal laws, except as otherwise provided:</p>

<p>(A) "Vehicle" means every device, including a motorized bicycle, in,
upon, or by which any person or property may be transported or drawn upon a
highway, except that "vehicle" does not include any motorized wheelchair, any
electric personal assistive mobility device, any device that is moved by power
collected from overhead electric trolley wires or that is used exclusively upon
stationary rails or tracks, or any device, other than a bicycle, that is moved
by human power.</p></div>

<div class="comment">
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> A bicycle is defined as a vehicle and thus is governed
by a uniform set of rules common to all vehicles and a small set of specific
rules for bicycles. (There are other specific rules for other vehicle
types, such as trucks or busses.) The annotated list here summarizes the
most important parts of the traffic rules and equipment rules that govern
bicycle driving. People who try to make up their own rules have an
accident rate five times higher than knowledgeable cyclists who follow the rules
of the road.</p>

<h3>&sect; 4511.07. Local traffic regulations.</h3>

<div class="law"><p>(A) Sections 4511.01 to 4511.78, 4511.99, and 4513.01 to 4513.37 of the Revised Code do not prevent local authorities from carrying out the following activities with respect to streets and highways under their jurisdiction and within the reasonable exercise of the police power:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>(8) Regulating the operation of bicycles: provided that no such
    regulation shall be fundamentally inconsistent with the uniform rules of the
    road prescribed by this chapter and that no such regulation shall prohibit the
    use of bicycles on any public street or highway except as provided in section
    4511.051 of the Revised Code;</li>

    <li>(9) Requiring the registration and licensing of bicycles,
    including the requirement of a registration fee for residents of the local
    authority;</li>
  </ul>

<p>(B) No ordinance or regulation enacted under division (A)(4), (5), (6), (7),
(8), or (10) of this section shall be effective until signs giving notice of the
local traffic regulations are posted upon or at the entrance to the highway or
part of the highway affected, as may be most appropriate.</p></div>

<div class="comment">
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> The most important of the reforms passed in 2006
requires that any local regulations be consistent with the uniform rules of the
road. In addition, signs are required to tell of any permitted local
regulations. Unfortunately, some communities have been very slow to remove
non-conforming ordinances that mandate unsafe practices.</p>

<section id='direction'>
<h3>&sect; 4511.25. Lanes of travel upon roadways of sufficient width.</h3>

<div class="law"><p>(A) Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle or trackless trolley shall
be driven upon the right half of the roadway except as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(1) When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the
same direction, or when making a left turn under the rules governing such
movements;</li>
  <li>(2) When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the
left of the center of the highway; provided, any person so doing shall yield the
right of way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;</li>
  <li>(3) When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked
lanes for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;</li>
  <li>(4) When driving upon a roadway designated and posted with signs for
one-way traffic;</li>
  <li>(5) When otherwise directed by a police officer or traffic control
device.</li>
</ul>

<p>(B)(1) Upon all roadways any vehicle or trackless trolley proceeding at less
than the prevailing and lawful speed of traffic at the time and place and under
the conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then
available for traffic, and far enough to the right to allow passing by faster
vehicles if such passing is safe and reasonable, except under any of the
following circumstances:</p>

<ul>
   <li>(a) When overtaking and passing another vehicle or
trackless trolley proceeding in the same direction:</li>
   <li>(b) When preparing for a left turn;</li>
   <li>(c) When the driver must necessarily drive in a lane other
than the right-hand lane to continue on the driver's intended route.</li>
</ul>

  <p>(2) Nothing in division (B)(1) of this section requires a driver
of a slower vehicle to compromise the driver's safety to allow overtaking by a
faster vehicle.</p></div>

<div class="comment">
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Section 4511.25(A) is a general rule that applies to
all vehicles, including bicycles. Some people think it is safer to ride on
the left to "see traffic coming". This is illegal and wrong!
Pedestrians walk facing traffic so they can sidestep off the road if
necessary. But you cannot sidestep a bike. Riding on the left is
both illegal and dangerous. Crash statistics show that <strong>wrong way riding
has about 3&frac12; times the risk</strong> as riding on the right.</p>

<p>Section 4511.25(B) simply means that slower vehicles should not unnecessarily
delay faster traffic. (See also &sect; 4511.55 below.)</p>
</div>
</section>

<hr>

<section id='passing'>
<h3>&sect; 4511.27. Overtaking and passing of vehicles proceeding in the same direction.</h3>

<div class='law'>
<p>The following rules govern the overtaking and passing of vehicles or trackless
trolleys proceeding in the same direction:</p>

<p>(A) The operator of a vehicle or trackless trolley overtaking another vehicle or
trackless trolley proceeding in the same direction shall &hellip; pass to the left
thereof at a safe distance, and shall not again drive to the right side of the
roadway until safely clear of the overtaken vehicle or trackless trolley.</p>

<p>(B) Except when overtaking and passing on the right is permitted, the operator
of an overtaken vehicle shall give way to the right in favor of the overtaking
vehicle at the latter's audible signal, and he shall not increase the speed of
his vehicle until completely passed by the overtaking vehicle.</p>
</div>

<div class='comment'>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Since cyclists usually ride near the right side of the
road, beginners are tempted to pass slow or stopped traffic on the right,
especially in a "bicycle lane" with a painted line. Passing on the right
is often dangerous and, in many cases, illegal.</p>
</div>
</section>

<hr>

<section id='hazards'>
<h3>&sect;4511.31. Hazardous zones</h3>

<div class='law'>
<p>(A) The department of transportation may determine those portions of any state
highway where overtaking and passing other traffic or driving to the left of the
center or center line of the roadway would be especially hazardous and may, by
appropriate signs or markings on the highway, indicate the beginning and end of
such zones. &hellip;</p>

<p>(B) Division (A) of this section does not apply when all of the following
apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(1) The slower vehicle is proceeding at less than half the speed
of the speed limit applicable to that location.</li>
  <li>(2) The faster vehicle is capable of overtaking and passing the
slower vehicle without exceeding the speed limit.</li>
  <li>(3) There is sufficient clear sight distance to the left of the
center or center line of the roadway to meet the overtaking and passing
provisions of section 4511.29 of the Revised Code, considering the speed of the
slower vehicle.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class='comment'>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Section 4511.31(B) should help reduce tension between
cyclists and faster drivers. Now, they can pass in "no passing" zones IF
passing is safe.</p>
</div>

<section id='intersections'>
<h3>&sect; 4511.36. Rules for turns at intersections.</h3>
<div class='law'>
<p>The driver of a vehicle intending to turn at an intersection shall be
governed by the following rules:</p>

<p>(A) Approach for a right turn and a right turn shall be made as close as
practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway.</p>

<p>(B) At any intersection where traffic is permitted to move in both directions on
each roadway entering the intersection, an approach for a left turn shall be
made in that portion of the right half of the roadway nearest the center line
thereof and by passing to the right of such center line where it enters the
intersection and after entering the intersection the left turn shall be made so
as to leave the intersection to the right of the center line of the roadway
being entered. Whenever practicable the left turn shall be made in that
portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the
intersection.</p>
</div>

<div class='comment'>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> The rules for turns are <strong><em>exactly the same</em></strong>
for bicycles as for other vehicles &ndash; merge to the appropriate position (right
for right turns, left for left turns), yield to any traffic that has the right
of way and then turn. A cyclist also has the option to make turns as a
pedestrian by dismounting and walking the bicycle through the intersection.</p>

<p>Getting into position for a left turn may involve merging across lanes of
traffic. If traffic is heavy, you should start doing this early to take
advantage of gaps in traffic. Otherwise, there may not be a gap when you
need it. Beginners, who have not yet developed the skill to merge in
traffic, may make pedestrian-style turns instead.</p>
</div>
</section>

<section id="turning-stopping">
<h3>&sect; 4511.39. Turn and stop signals.</h3>
<div class='law'>
<p>No person shall turn a vehicle or trackless trolley or move right or left upon a
highway unless and until such person has exercised due care to ascertain that
the movement can be made with reasonable safety nor without giving an
appropriate signal in the manner hereinafter provided.</p>

<p>When required, a signal of intention to turn or move right or left shall be
given continuously during not less than the last one hundred feet traveled by
the vehicle or trackless trolley before turning, except that in the case of a
person operating a bicycle, the signal shall be made not less than one time but
is not required to be continuous. A bicycle operator is not required to
make a signal if the bicycle is in a designated turn lane, and a signal shall
not be given when the operator's hands are needed for the safe operation of the
bicycle. &hellip;</p>
</div>

<div class='comment'>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Never turn or change lanes without first <strong><em>yielding
to any traffic that has the right of way</em></strong>, and give a signal if
possible. However, skip the signal if your hand is needed for control or
brakes.</p>
</div>
</section>

<hr>

<section id="signals">
<h3>&sect; 4511.40. Hand and arm signals.</h3>
<div class='law'>
<p>(A) Except as provided in division (B) of this section, all signals required
by sections 4511.01 to 4511.78 of the Revised Code, when given by hand and arm,
shall be given from the left side of the vehicle in the following manner, and
such signals shall indicate as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) Left turn, hand and arm extended horizontally;</li>
  <li>(2) Right turn, hand and arm extended upward;</li>
  <li>(3) Stop or decrease speed, hand and arm extended downward.</li>
</ul>

<p>(B) As an alternative to division (A)(2) of this section, a person operating a
bicycle may give a right turn signal by extending the right hand and arm
horizontally and to the right side of the bicycle.</p>
</div>

<div class='comment'>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> The right-arm turn signal described in (B) above is
more easily understood.</p>

<section id="tickets">
<h3>&sect; 4511.52. Bicycles - issuance of ticket - points not assessed.</h3>
<div class='law'>
<p>(A) Sections 4511.01 to 4511.78, 4511.99, and 4513.01 to 4513.37, of the Revised
Code that are applicable to bicycles apply whenever a bicycle is operated upon
any highway or upon any path set aside for the exclusive use of
bicycles.</p>

<p>(B) Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a bicycle operator who
violates any section of the Revised Code described in division (A) of this
section that is applicable to bicycles may be issued a ticket, citation, or
summons by a law enforcement officer for the violation in the same manner as the
operator of a motor vehicle would be cited for the same violation. A
person who commits any such violation while operating a bicycle shall not have
any points assessed against the person's driver's license, commercial driver's
license, temporary instruction permit, or probationary license under section
4510.036 of the Revised Code.</p>

<p>(C) Except as provided in division (D) of this section, in the case of a
violation of any section of the Revised Code described in division (A) of this
section by a bicycle operator or by a motor vehicle operator when the trier of
fact finds that the violation by the motor vehicle operator endangered the lives
of bicycle riders at the time of the violation, the court, notwithstanding any
provision of the Revised Code to the contrary, may require the bicycle operator
or motor vehicle operator to take and successfully complete a bicycling skills
course approved by the court in addition to or in lieu of any penalty otherwise
prescribed by the Revised Code for that violation.</p>
</div>

<div class='coment'>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> 4511.52(A) Means that the standard traffic rules apply
to bicycle drivers. These driving laws allow safe, fast and efficient
travel. Riding on sidewalks or multi-use "bike paths" is moderately safe
<strong>only if done at slow speeds and extremely carefully</strong>. Riding on
paths is popular for recreation but provides only limited utility for
transportation. Path riding is not covered in this digest. (B) Means
that bicycle violators may be ticketed but will not have "points" assessed
against any driver's license, except for a DWI offense. (C) allows judges
to offer a cycling skills course to violators.</p>

<h3>&sect; 4511.54. Prohibition against attaching bicycles and sleds to vehicles.</h3>
<div class='law'>
<p>No person riding upon any bicycle, coaster, roller skates, sled, or toy vehicle
shall attach the same or self to any streetcar, trackless trolley, or vehicle
upon a roadway.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h3>&sect; 4511.55. Operating bicycles and motorcycles on roadway.</h3>

<div class='law'>
<p>(A) Every person operating a bicycle upon a roadway shall ride as near to the
right side of the roadway as practicable obeying all traffic rules applicable to
vehicles and exercising due care when passing a standing vehicle or one
proceeding in the same direction.</p>

<p>(B) Persons riding bicycles or motorcycles upon a roadway shall ride not more
than two abreast in a single lane, except on paths or parts of roadways set
aside for the exclusive use of bicycles or motorcycles.</p>

<p>(C) This section does not require a person operating a bicycle to ride at the
edge of the roadway when it is unreasonable or unsafe to do so. Conditions
that may require riding away from the edge of the roadway include when necessary
to avoid fixed or moving objects, parked or moving vehicles, surface hazards, or
if it otherwise is unsafe or impracticable to do so, including if the lane is
too narrow for the bicycle and an overtaking vehicle to travel safely side by
side within the lane.</p>
</div>

<div class='comment'>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Section 4511.55(A) is very often misquoted to say that
cyclists are required to ride <em>as near as possible</em> to the curb. The
new paragraph (C) should help reduce this confusion. There are many
conditions where it is much safer to ride near the middle of the lane. It
is not <strong>practicable</strong> (practice-able) to ride on the far right when passing
or turning left; or when avoiding objects, parked cars, moving vehicles,
pedestrians, animals, surface or other hazards; or when the travel lane is too
narrow for a bicycle and another vehicle to pass safely side by side within the
lane.</p>

<p> Many motorists are reluctant to cross a lane line when passing a
bicycle. A cyclist who "hugs the curb" unintentionally invites motorists
to pass with unsafe clearance. Riding near the middle of a narrow lane
helps overtaking motorists realize that they must must use the next lane to
pass.</p>

<p>The real purpose of this law is to prevent unnecessary delay to faster
traffic. Since the law cannot require unsafe operation, the phrase <em>as
close as practicable</em> is highly flexible, varying widely according to
conditions. Positions well away from the edge of the road can be in
compliance.</p>

<p>Section 4511.55(B) allows riding two abreast. However, cyclists should
avoid unnecessary delay to other traffic. Please be courteous and "single
up" when other drivers wish to pass if such passing is safe and
reasonable. There is no violation if any of the following apply: (1)
If there is no traffic being delayed; (2) If the cyclists are traveling as fast
as other traffic; (3) If traffic can reasonably pass by using another lane; (4)
If the lane is too narrow or it is otherwise unsafe for passing.</p>

<section id="lighting">
<h3>&sect; 4511.56. Bicycle signal devices.</h3>

<div class='law'>
<p>(A) Every bicycle when in use at the times specified in section 4513.03 of the
Revised Code, shall be equipped with the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>(1) A lamp mounted on the front of either the bicycle or the
operator that shall emit a white light visible from a distance of at least five
hundred feet to the front and three hundred feet to the sides. A
generator-powered lamp that emits light only when the bicycle is moving may be
used to meet this requirement.</li>

  <li>(2) A red reflector on the rear that shall be visible from all
distances from one hundred feet to six hundred feet to the rear when directly in
front of lawful lower beams of head lamps on a motor vehicle;</li>

  <li>(3) A lamp emitting either flashing or steady red light visible
from a distance of five hundred feet to the rear shall be used in addition to
the red reflector. If the red lamp performs as a reflector in that it is
visible as specified in division (A)(2) of this section, the red lamp may serve
as the reflector and a separate reflector is not required.</li>
</ul>

<p>(B) Additional lamps and reflectors may be used in addition to those required
under division (A) of this section, except that red lamps and red reflectors
shall not be used on the front of the bicycle and white lamps and white
reflectors shall not be used on the rear of the bicycle.</p>

<p>(C) A bicycle may be equipped with a device capable of giving an audible signal,
except that a bicycle shall not be equipped with nor shall any person use upon a
bicycle any siren or whistle.</p>

<p>(D) Every bicycle shall be equipped with an adequate brake when used on a street
or highway.</p>
</div>

<div class='comment'>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> An unseen cyclist is in great danger. According
to the Ohio Dept. of Public Safety data for 2007, about 62 percent of fatal
bicycle crashes in Ohio occur during non-daylight hours (even though few
cyclists ride then).   The reflectors that come with new bikes are grossly
inadequate for nighttime visibility. Always use both a headlight and
taillight when you ride in the dark.</p>

<section id="sidewalk">
<h3>&sect; 4511.711. Driving upon sidewalk area.</h3>

<div class='law'>
<p>No person shall drive any vehicle, other than a bicycle, upon a sidewalk or
sidewalk area except upon a permanent or duly authorized temporary driveway.</p>

<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting local authorities from
regulating the operation of bicycles within their respective jurisdictions,
except that no local authority may require that bicycles be operated on
sidewalks.</p>
</div>

<div class="comment">
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> Although this section allows riding on sidewalks, don't
do it. Accident studies show that even low-speed sidewalk riding has about
double the accident rate as riding on the road. The danger increases with
speed. If you ride on the sidewalk, every intersection and even every
 driveway is a potential collision site. Motorists crossing your path do
not look for conflicting traffic on the sidewalk, especially if you are coming
from the "wrong way".</p>
